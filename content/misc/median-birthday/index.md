How many humans have ever lived? Most sources will give a number just north of 100 billion, regardless of how far back you start counting. It then seems only natural to ask when we collectively hit the 50% mark -- that is, if there was a generation living right in the middle of the whole human story, when were they born?

#### Introduction and motivation

The most widely accepted answer to the question "how many humans have ever lived?" seems to come from modelling conducted by Carl Haub at the Population Reference Bureau, an American NGO. The original study[^1] was conducted in 1995 and they have published a number of updates since then, the most recent[^2] being in 2020.

As outlined in those articles, the modelling approach taken was to divide human history into a series of intervals during which the birth rate is assumed to be basically constant. Choose a start year somewhere in the Paleolithic and a starting population size, then apply the appropriate birth rate to get the following year's new births.

Keep repeating this and cumulatively summing each year's new births and you get a table like this:

#### Modelling assumptions and restrictions

It's immediately clear from the above table that we hit the 50 billion mark sometime in the first millenium. Before attempting to get a more precise (if not necessarily accurate!) estimate of the median birthday, we first need to be able to reproduce the PRB results.

Although the birth rate excludes stillbirths, it's important to keep in mind the difference between "ever born" and "ever lived" in the context of high pre-modern infant mortality rates:

> Our birth rate assumption will greatly affect the estimate of the number of people who have ever lived. Infant mortality in the modern human race’s earliest days is thought to have been very high—perhaps 500 infant deaths per 1,000 births, or even higher. Children were probably an economic liability among hunter-gatherer societies, a fact likely to have led to the practice of infanticide. Under these circumstances, a disproportionately large number of births would be required to maintain population growth, and that would raise our estimated number of the “ever born.”

Counting births only makes the modelling much simpler, since otherwise mortality rates would likewise need to be estimated across different intervals of human history. One consequence of this is that the year-by-year population figures (which are model inputs) come from interpolations between known population levels at points in time, rather than being generated by the model itself.

Although there is extensive literature on more advanced methods of reckoning with these vast demographic statistics[^4]<sup>, </sup>[^5] this post will try to adhere to the Haub (2011) table above, which most of the literature seems to take at face value anyway.

#### Reproducing it in Python

Everything below should be reproducible in a JupyterLab notebook with the appropriate packages installed. First we're going to import those packages, then set up some basic variables and data structures necessary for the modelling.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import plotly.graph_objects as go

pd.set_option('float_format', '{:,.0f}'.format)

starting_pop = 2
starting_brate = 40
birth_regime = {
    # Year: [population, birth_rate]
    -50000: [starting_pop, starting_brate],
    -8000: [5e6, 40],
    1: [300e6, 40],
    1200: [450e6, 60],
    1650: [500e6, 60],
    1750: [795e6, 50],
    1850: [1265e6, 40],
    1900: [1656e6, 40],
    1950: [2516e6, 32],
    1995: [5760e6, 24],
    2011: [6987e6, 20],
    2019: [7692e6, 19],
}

min_date = -50000
max_date = 2021

df = pd.DataFrame(index=range(min_date, max_date))

for year in birth_regime.keys():
    df.loc[year, 'population'] = birth_regime[year][0]
    df.loc[year, 'birth_rate'] = birth_regime[year][1]

print(df.loc[birth_regime.keys()])

```

This returns the following reproduction of Table 1 above, except that not shown is that the table also includes every year between these known values, just filled with `NaN` values.

```
          population  birth_rate
-50000             2          40
-8000      5,000,000          40
 1       300,000,000          40
 1200    450,000,000          60
 1650    500,000,000          60
 1750    795,000,000          50
 1850  1,265,000,000          40
 1900  1,656,000,000          40
 1950  2,516,000,000          32
 1995  5,760,000,000          24
 2011  6,987,000,000          20
 2019  7,692,000,000          19

```

You will have noticed that, whereas Haub puts the birth rate at `80` for every period up to 1 A.D., in the above construction the rate is halved for that period of time. This was the only way I was able to get results close to what is shown in the Haub/PRB table above. Perhaps it reflects that, in implementing their model, they actually do take into account the supposed 50% infant mortality rate referenced in the quote above.

The code below will first make linear interpolations between the known variables shown above; then having estimated population and birth rate values for every year between 50,000 B.C. and the present time, it will calculate the number of births in each year. Cumulatively summing these new birth numbers should give the total number of people ever born.

```python
df['birth_rate'] = df['birth_rate'].interpolate(method='linear')
df['population'] = df['population'].interpolate(method='linear')
# Birth rates are given per 1000 population per year
df['new_births'] = df['population'] * (1/1000) * df['birth_rate']
df['cum_births'] = df['new_births'].cumsum()

# Print the results
print(df.loc[birth_regime.keys()])
print('\n....\n')

# Total number of births is the latest cumulative births number
alltime_births = df.loc[df.index[-1],'cum_births']
# Median birth year is the last year where the cumulative population
# to date was less than or equal to half of today's cumulative score
median_birthyear = df.loc[df['cum_births'] <= alltime_births/2].index[-1]
# Format and print
birthyear_prefix = np.where(median_birthyear < 0, 'B.C.', 'A.D.')
print(f'median birth year: {abs(median_birthyear)} {birthyear_prefix}')
```

Which returns the following summary and result:

```
          population  birth_rate  new_births      cum_births
-50000             2          40           0               0
-8000      5,000,000          40     200,000   4,200,101,680
 1       300,000,000          40  12,000,000  53,012,101,680
 1200    450,000,000          60  27,000,000  75,800,602,097
 1650    500,000,000          60  30,000,000  88,627,102,097
 1750    795,000,000          50  39,750,000  92,168,638,847
 1850  1,265,000,000          40  50,600,000  96,769,889,347
 1900  1,656,000,000          40  66,240,000  99,698,709,347
 1950  2,516,000,000          32  80,512,000 103,431,955,747
 1995  5,760,000,000          24 138,240,000 108,577,283,629
 2011  6,987,000,000          20 139,740,000 110,814,910,504
 2019  7,692,000,000          19 146,148,000 111,962,591,816

....

median birth year: 231 A.D.

```

#### Conclusion

It's clear that this method only imperfectly reproduces the data upon which Haub's work was based -- hence any conclusion about the median birth year will be subject to great error. However it seems that we can at least narrow it down somewhat, and the code above can easily be improved by adding more data to the `birth_regime` structure, or else by better interpolating between the known data.
